# Verifies the ActiveRecord connection is alive before each request.
#
# Rationale: Fly suspends the VM after idle; during suspend the OS clock
# pauses, so Rails's `idle_timeout` never fires and TCP keepalives don't
# detect dead sockets. On resume, pooled connections may point at a Neon
# branch that has also auto-suspended. `verify!` sends a cheap ping and
# reconnects if the socket is dead — absorbing the Neon cold-start cost
# here instead of letting it bubble up as a 504 at the Fly proxy.
#
# Skips Fly's health-check and metrics paths. Both are polled continuously
# (/up every 10s, /metrics every 15s), so there is never a cold start to
# absorb on them — verifying would only keep the Neon compute from ever
# reaching its idle-suspend threshold, burning compute hours around the clock.
